#### About:

##### War (also known as Battle in the United Kingdom) is a card game typically played by two players. It uses a standard playing card deck. Due to its simplicity, it is played most often by children. There are many variations, including the German 32-card variant Tod und Leben ("Life and Death").

#### The Objective:

##### The goal is to not allow your points to go to 0

#### The Deal:

##### The deck is divided evenly, with each player receiving 26 cards, dealt one at a time, face down.

#### The Play:

##### Each player turns up a card at the same time and the player with the higher card takes both cards and puts them, face down, on the bottom of his stack. If the players encounter the unfortonate situation of revealing two of the same cards, it is War... Both players must sacrifice 3 cards from their deck.

#### The Score:

##### The game ends when one player has 0 points.
